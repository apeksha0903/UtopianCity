# UtopianCity

## Developed and implemented a comprehensive city management system using C, featuring robust management functionalities for various city components. This project highlights:

- Efficient System Design: Utilized Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C to build an efficient and scalable system, ensuring optimal performance and management.
- Utopian City Model: Constructed a detailed utopian city model, including houses, buildings, and other infrastructure elements. This model supports seamless management and interaction among different components.
- Real-World Applications: Enhanced understanding of DSA by applying concepts to real-world scenarios, demonstrating the ability to design and manage complex systems effectively.
  
This project not only showcases technical skills in C programming and DSA but also illustrates practical application in city management scenarios.
